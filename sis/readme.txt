These files are the binary version of the full example solution
of the MoboPlayer application. The binaries have been compiled using
Metrowerks Codewarrior v 2.8.3 and Series 60 SDK 2nd ed. Feature Pack 2,
and thus work with only that version of the Series 60 SDK.

Copy the included files 

-MoboPlayer.aif
-MoboPlayer.app
-MoboPlayereng.dll
-MoboPlayer.rsc
-MoboPlayer_caption.rsc

into following location:

<path-to-your-sdk-root>\epoc32\release\winscw\udeb\z\system\apps\MoboPlayer\

Also, copy the file

-PlayerAnimations.mbm

to the location:

<path-to-your-sdk-root>\epoc32\winscw\c\system\apps\MoboPlayer\

Also copy wav files to the emulator's sound directories to be able
to play the sound files from the application. Get the sound files
and instructions on how to install them from the Symbian assignment
web pages.

Launch the emulator. The MoboPlayer application (MPlayer) should be visible
in the emulator's list of applications.
